/*
Given an array of words, it sorts the words based on the rearrangered letters of each word

NOTE: The above sucks, not sure how to explain.

Example:

Given [coat, actor, bad]

returns

[bad, coat, actor]

Because:

bad -> abd
coat -> acor
actor -> acort

Interesting because it introduces an intermediate representation of the list, which can open up to performance questions
